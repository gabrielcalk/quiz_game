## *Description*

The project presented here is a QUIZ created with HTML, CSS and JS.

When entering the quiz, you can view the scores that have been saved in your local storage or start the game and add a new score.

In this case, this project has 5 questions, where at the end you will receive your score that will be measured by the time it took you to answer all the questions and the chance to save your score with the initials of your name and middle name.
